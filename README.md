# odin-recipes
The current project is creating recipies. my first trial to coding
After completing the First to Third recipes, i have now learned to memorise the command to add, commit, and push to github.
I have also learned to memorise the html-boiler, to structure the files in an organized form, link other files and images, and to create unordered and ordered lists.
