        <h1>Miso Soup recipe</h1>
        <img src="images/image.webp">
        <p>Dashi is a basic stock used in Japanese cooking which is made by boiling dried kelp (seaweed) and dried bonito (fish). Instant dashi granules are sold in conveniently-sized jars or packets and vary in strength. Add more dashi to your soup if you want a stronger stock. You can use yellow, white or red miso paste for this soup. Yellow miso is sweet and creamy, red miso is stronger and saltier.</p>
        <p>Ingredients</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons dashi granules</li>
